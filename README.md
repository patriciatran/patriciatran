# Welcome! üëã

My name is Patricia Tran and I'm a Bioinformatics Scientist & Research Cyberinfrastructure Specialist for the Department of Bacteriology at UW-Madison. 

# Programming Languages üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
I use, teach and train researchers on how to use bioinformatics and data science skills in research. Some foundational skills are using **Bash** to write code and interact with software. I also build containers (**Docker**, **Apptainer**), and use workflow managers (**Nextflow**, **Snakemake**) to automate pipelines. We rely on many useful tools such as **anaconda**'s package managers. I implement, troubleshoot, and teach users how to use computing infrastructure (which uses **HTCondor** and **SLURM** job schedulers) to submit, manage, and run jobs on remote cyberinfrastructure. For post-sequencing data analysis, I use **R** and **Python**. I also sometimes volunteer with the **Carpentries**.

# Biology & Education üå±
I got involved in bioinformatics through my training in biology and environmental sciences. Since then, I've learnt, implemented, and taught (micro)-biologists of all career stages on how to use computing and data science to make analyse their data, and gain practical skills to make their research more pleasant. I have enjoyed an interdisciplinary science training over the years, having obtained a PhD in Freshwater Sciences, a MS in (Micro)-Biology, a graduate certificate in Bioinformatics, and a BS Honors in Conservation Biology. 

# Outside work 
I enjoy hobbies that connect me to the world and spark creativity, such as gardening, climbing, biking, and ceramics wheel throwing.
