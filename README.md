# Welcome! üëã

My name is Patricia Tran and I'm a Bioinformatics Scientist & Research Cyberinfrastructure Specialist for the Department of Bacteriology at UW-Madison.

I use, teach and train researchers on how to use bioinformatics and data science skills in research. Some foundational skills are using **Bash** to write code and interact with software. I also build containers (**Docker**, **Apptainer**), and use workflow managers (**Nextflow**, **Snakemake**) to automate pipelines. We rely on many useful tools such as **anaconda**'s package managers. I implement, troubleshoot, and teach users how to use computing infrastructure (which uses **HTCondor** and **SLURM** job schedulers) to submit, manage, and run jobs on remote cyberinfrastructure. For post-sequencing data analysis, I use **R** and **Python**. I also sometimes volunteer with the **Carpentries**.
